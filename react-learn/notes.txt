PROPS:

Props / Properties are arguments passed into React components.

Props allows us to pass data from parent component to a child component

Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.




CONDITIONAL RENDERING:

Conditional rendering allows us to dynamically display different UI components or content based on specific conditions. This enables us to create more interactive and responsive user experiences


------## State ##-----
State is a way to "store and manage" data that can change over
time and affects how the component renders. We define state
using the useState Hook, which allows you to set an initial
value and provides a way to update that state.


-----## HOOKS ##-----
Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8
They let you use state and other React features
without writing a class.


-----## useState() ##-----
useState Hook allows us to "track state" in a
functional component. State generally refers
to data or properties that need to be
tracking in an application.
